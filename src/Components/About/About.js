      <p className="mb-5">Our goal is to create the best possible coding school at the cost of a gym membership. If we succeed with this, it will give anyone who wants to become a software developer a realistic shot at succeeding. Regardless of where they live and the size of their wallets.

To achieve this, we have created a new video format for code screencasts. We call it “scrims”. This format is the backbone of our school. Not only because it results in a superior learning experience. But also because it enables us to iterate more quickly, to attract better teachers, to facilitate better peer-learning, to keep server costs low, and much more.</p>
